Yo do we got a name for the bot?
Just connect to the voice channel (the one that me and the bot are connected to) to listen to the music
music
<@!735906189866434640> no need to ask if you can edit stuff on the repl, you can edit whenever you want!
maybe we could have separate categories for happy music and intense music
Wowww music is playing so coolllll😍
:D !!!!
I am gonna come here everytime i wanna hear music!!!!!!  <@412425583725903883>
If you know any intense songs or happy songs then put them in the txt files!
Wait i will do it
intense would be like super upbeat but they don't necessarily have to be happy
make sure the links are from youtube!
wait I think all of the songs in "energetic" are already kinda happy
we can have intense that's more angry/in a minor key or something
Okkk
